## My git workflow

In this project I practice:

- Good commit messages,
- Well named branches,
- Pull requests with summaries

If you have feedback to improve my git usage: **[please drop me a line here!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovani-zanetti-ab664a24/)** or e-mail me at zanetti.giovani@gmail.com.


## My workflow

I break the main problem into smaller problems, those smaller problems in even smaller pieces until I have tiny problems. 

I resolve one at the time, code, test, commit and push to Github.

Usually, when I encounter a bug which is not related to the functionality I am working with, I take a note to tackle it later.

If I have any idea during the development process, I take a note and try to implement it later.

I like using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/KiV34P0Y/my-pomodoro) to help with my notes. 
If I get stuck I always try to find the solution in one of the options:
  - Documentation
  - Google
  - Stackoverflow
  - Youtube / Udemy tutorials


## Create React App

This project was scaffolded using the create-react-app cli.

**[The standard create-react-app docs can be found in here](./REACT-README.md)**
